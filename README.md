# CS.11.04-Lab.4.1

All of the methods should be implemented within the Main class. 
Declare all methods as static.
For questions 5. and 6. you may want to check out how to use the StringBuilder class.

1. Write a method called parenthesesCheck that takes a string of parentheses, and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid. The function should return true if the string is valid, and false if it's invalid.

Examples

"()"              =>  true
")(()))"          =>  false
"("               =>  false
"(())((()())())"  =>  true


2. Write a method called reverseInteger that reverses the digits in an integer. Return the digits as a string.

Examples

1234 => “4321”
2468 => “8642”


3. You are given a message you need to encrypt. Here are the things you need to know to encrypt it:

For each word:

the second and the last letter is switched (e.g. Hello becomes Holle)
the first letter is replaced by its character code (e.g. H becomes 72)
Note: there are no special characters used, only letters and spaces

Examples

encryptThis('Hello good day'); // '72olle 103doo 100ya'
encryptThis('Ready set go'); // '82yade 115te 103o'


4. You are given a secret message you need to decipher. Here are the things you need to know to decipher it:

For each word:

the second and the last letter is switched (e.g. Hello becomes Holle)
the first letter is replaced by its character code (e.g. H becomes 72)
Note: there are no special characters used, only letters and spaces

Examples

decipherThis('72olle 103doo 100ya'); // 'Hello good day'
decipherThis('82yade 115te 103o'); // 'Ready set go'
